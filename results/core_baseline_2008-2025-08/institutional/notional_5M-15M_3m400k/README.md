> **Summary:** on a yearly cut, dynamics are steadily positive: the mean and median year are in the black. Within-year drawdowns by month-end are shallow; intramonth drawdowns are deeper but controlled. Roughly 70% winning trades and PF ~1.6 at moderate volatility yield a predictable calendar profile with restrained tail risks.

### Monthly returns 
- Coverage: **212** months (2008-01‚Äî2025-08). Mean/median month: **0.36% / 0.22%** (P10/P90: **‚àí0.79% / 1.69%**).

> **Summary**: monthly dynamics are even: a small but repeatable premium; a notably larger share of positive months; restrained tails without destructive outliers. Extremes stay within the ‚Äúworking corridor‚Äù; losing streaks are short and are quickly offset; zero months naturally interrupt trends ‚Äî the overall profile is calm and predictable.

### DD quantiles 
> Drawdown quantiles are shown signed (negative), while xRisk = |DD| is published as a positive magnitude. Therefore, as the percentile rises, DD values approach 0, and xRisk values decrease.
- Observations / episodes: **132** points; **20** drawdown episodes.

- Time under water: **P90 19** months, **P95 27** months.
- Depth in xRisk scale: **P90 0.35**, **P95 0.24**, **P99 0.02**.
> **Summary:** drawdowns are mostly shallow, tails are moderate; time underwater is typically from several quarters to a couple of years; calendar and xRisk quantiles are aligned ‚Äî destructive tails are not observed.

### Rolling 12m
- Windows: **201**; incomplete windows: **0**.  
- Window return (12m): mean/median **4.59% / 2.70%** (P10/P90: **‚àí0.84% / 12.57%**); best/worst window end: **2011-01 (20.24%) / 2013-02 (‚àí4.20%)**.  
- Share of windows by sign: positive **162**, negative **39**, zero **0**.  
- Risk/quality (window medians): volatility (annual) **3.21%**, Sharpe **1.26**, Sortino **1.23**, Calmar **2.82**; window MaxDD **‚àí1.29%**.  
- Window composition (medians): active **91.67%** (~11 of 12), positive **58.33%**, negative **25.00%**.  
- Tails and asymmetry (medians): **Tail 1.71**, **Omega 2.55**; **VaR95 ‚àí0.67% / ES95 ‚àí1.07%**.
> **Summary:** on the 12‚Äëmonth horizon, the picture is smooth: most windows are positive; dispersion is moderate; within-window drawdowns are shallow and recover quickly; risk-adjusted quality sits comfortably above neutral; tails are restrained; and the share of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù months consistently dominates losing months in the window.

### Rolling 36m 
- Windows: 177; incomplete windows: **0**.  
- Annualized window return: mean/median **4.26% / 3.39%**; **P10/P90:** **0.16% / 8.84%**; **best/worst window end:** **2011-10 (14.61%) / 2024-05 (‚àí0.29%)**.  
- Shares of windows by sign: positive **168**, negative **8**, zero **1**.  
- Risk/quality (medians): volatility (annual) **3.07%**, **Sharpe 1.22**, **Sortino 2.34**, **Calmar 1.86**; **window MaxDD ‚àí2.30%**.  
- Window composition (medians): active **86.11%** (~31 of 36), positive **52.78%**, negative **22.22%**.  
- Tails and asymmetry (medians): **Tail 1.86**, **Omega 3.26**; **VaR95 ‚àí0.87% / ES95 ‚àí1.62%**.
> **Summary:** the vast majority of windows are positive; negative episodes are rare and shallow. Returns are moderate at low volatility; risk-adjusted metrics sit confidently above neutral; a typical within-window drawdown is compact; windows are dominated by active and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù months; and tail risks by VaR/ES and tail metrics are restrained ‚Äî together yielding a smooth capital path and predictable results over the three‚Äëyear interval.

### Monte Carlo
- Method: **stationary_bootstrap**.
- Horizons: **12, 36, 212 months**.
- Average block lengths: **3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 months**.
- Risk per trade: **1%**.
> **Summary:** the distributions show a persistent tilt toward favorable paths on short and medium horizons with a low probability of ‚Äúhard‚Äù breaches of drawdown thresholds; typical drawdowns remain moderate. As the horizon lengthens, sensitivity to rare adverse scenarios rises, yet xRisk-oriented control remains in place, and median ‚Äútime-to-threshold‚Äù often indicates the absence of critical breaches within the studied intervals. Overall, the simulated picture aligns with a conservative but positive profile: a smooth trajectory with manageable tail risks under disciplined risk management.

### Confidence Intervals 
- Interval method: **bootstrap_bca** (BCa ‚Äî bias‚Äëcorrected & accelerated).
- Bootstrap (EoM monthly): **stationary_bootstrap**, average block length **6 months**.
- Bootstrap (intramonth): **stationary_bootstrap**, average block length **5 days**.
- Confidence level: **90%**.
> **Summary:** confidence intervals confirm a conservative profile: the return component shows a steady positive drift over the full horizon, while risk metrics are statistically stable on the downside, reflecting shallow but systematic drawdowns. By year, risk characteristics are homogeneous with no signs of ‚Äúdestructive‚Äù tails. In sum, this supports a cautious yet positive quality assessment: moderate risks, predictable variability, and a statistically confirmed upward tendency.¬†

### Cash flows 
- **Rebasing events:** 2.
- **Cash flows:** **cash‚Äëout** (payouts): **1‚ÄØ356‚ÄØ808.34** for **2010** (EoY **2010‚Äë12**); **1‚ÄØ109‚ÄØ697.18** (EoY **2017‚Äë12**) ‚Äî **2** events; **cash‚Äëin** (deposits) **0.00** ‚Äî **0** events.
- **Extremes:** maximum **cash‚Äëout** ‚Äî **1‚ÄØ356‚ÄØ808.34** for **2010** (EoY **2010‚Äë12**).
- **Profit after the last rebasing** 441 916.82.
> **Summary:** net profit ~ **2 908 422.34**.

### Conclusion
Across the full horizon, the profile is consistently conservative: smooth growth at low volatility; calendar drawdowns are shallow and typically recover quickly; intramonth drawdowns are deeper but controlled. By month, the premium is small but repeatable; the share of positive months is noticeably larger; losing streaks are short. On yearly windows the outcome is predictable, and on multi‚Äëyear windows even and stable: risk‚Äëadjusted metrics sit confidently above neutral, and typical drawdowns are compact. Resampling simulations confirm that as the horizon lengthens, outcome dispersion narrows and the probability of a negative endpoint drops sharply; confidence intervals align with this and do not indicate destructive tails.
