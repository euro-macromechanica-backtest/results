- Tails and asymmetry (medians): **Tail 2.45**, **Omega 3.61**; **VaR95 -0.76% / ES95 -1.06%**.
> **Summary:** rolling 12‑month windows behave predictably: most are positive; risk over 12 months is low; within‑window drawdowns are shallow; tails are compact. Risk–return quality remains stable without reliance on rare spikes — dynamics are carried by the frequency of positive months and careful risk control, yielding a steady, resilient yearly window profile.

### Rolling 36m
- Windows: **177**; incomplete windows: **0**.
- Annualized window return: mean/median **7.02% / 5.55%** (P10/P90: **1.61% / 14.06%**); best/worst window end: **2011-10 (22.32%) / 2014-10 (0.63%)**.

- Tails and asymmetry (medians): **Tail 2.88**, **Omega 5.07**; **VaR95 -1.01% / ES95 -1.71%**.
> **Summary:** on a three‑year horizon, rolling windows show steady positive returns, low typical volatility, and compact within‑window drawdowns; tail risks are small, and risk–return (Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar) holds firm in the median. The shares of active and positive months within 36‑month windows support a smooth, “pulling” trajectory without dependence on rare bursts.

### Monte Carlo
- Method: **stationary_bootstrap**.
- Horizons: **12, 36, 212 months**.
- Average block lengths: **3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 months**.
- Risk per trade: **1%**.
> **Summary:** across all simulated horizons, outcomes appear stable and resilient. On short windows, an endpoint loss is possible, but risk of large monthly drawdowns is low. On the medium horizon, the median outcome improves notably, the probability of finishing negative drops sharply, and drawdowns occur more often yet remain manageable; in xRisk scale, the typical maximum drawdown rises predictably, while severe thresholds are rarely reached and usually only after considerable time. On the longest window, almost all paths finish positive: the annual return distribution “compresses” (the lower tail lifts, the upper tail becomes more moderate), so the endpoint becomes more predictable; along the way, moderate EoM drawdowns are nearly inevitable, while extreme ones remain rare. Cash‑out policies trigger rarely on short horizons, more often on medium‑long ones, increasing the event count materially with horizon length. In sum, simulations confirm a resilient profile: longer horizons raise the probability of a positive outcome and reduce uncertainty, with drawdowns along the way fitting expected bounds.

### Confidence Intervals 
- Interval method: **bootstrap_bca** (BCa — bias‑corrected & accelerated).
- Bootstrap (EoM monthly): **stationary_bootstrap**, average block length **6 months**.
- Bootstrap (intramonth): **stationary_bootstrap**, average block length **5 days**.
- Confidence level: **90%**.
> **Summary:** confidence intervals indicate that key estimates (annual return, volatility, monthly tails) are sufficiently stable: dispersion around them is small, implying the observed “premium” and risk level are reproducible on the historical sample. Intervals for month‑end drawdowns remain moderate, while intramonth intervals are wider, underscoring that intramonth swings are deeper but risk compresses at month‑end. VaR/ES confirm compact tails — extreme monthly outcomes are rare and bounded. Overall, CIs point to a predictable profile with low estimate uncertainty; conclusions pertain to the historical distribution (regime shifts and out‑of‑sample risks are not covered by CIs).

### Cash flows (USD)
- Rebasing events: **17**.
- Cash flows: **cash‑out** (payouts) **132 767.19** — 15 events; **cash‑in** (deposits) **3 236.98** — 2 events.
- Extremes: maximum cash‑out — **28 741.91** for **2010** (EoY 2010-12); maximum cash‑in — **2 918.93** for **2023** (EoY 2023-12).
- **Profit for the last year 2025-08** 2604.29.
> **Summary:** net profit ~ **132 134.51**.

### Conclusion
Over the full horizon of 17 years 8 months, the profile behaves smoothly and predictably: the monthly “premium” is small but repeatable; drawdowns by month‑end are shallow and recover quickly, while intramonth swings are more pronounced yet remain controlled. Trade statistics pull performance via a high share of winning trades under disciplined loss control — the “frequent small positives vs. rarer, larger negatives” pattern works when per‑trade risk is stable. By year, the picture avoids extremes: positive periods dominate, no long losing streaks; rolling 12‑ and 36‑month windows confirm stable risk–return. Monte Carlo across horizons shows distribution compression and a rising chance of finishing positive as horizon lengthens, while confidence intervals for key metrics are narrow — estimates are stable and not reliant on one‑off spikes. Rebasing cash flows sum to a positive amount, aligning with the overall dynamics: capital is “pulled” mainly by the frequency of positive periods and careful risk management, not by lucky one‑off surges.
