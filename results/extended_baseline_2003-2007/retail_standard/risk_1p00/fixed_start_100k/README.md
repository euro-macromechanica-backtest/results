## 📊 Summary — Retail Standard 7 USD/lot, `fixed_start_100k`, risk 1%

### Full period summary
- **CAGR 2.72%** with annual volatility **3.79%**; risk–return profile — **Sharpe 0.73**, **Sortino 1.24**, **MAR (full‑period Calmar) 0.49**.
- Drawdowns (on the continuous curve): **EoM MaxDD −5.54%**; recovery time — **not recovered (n/a)**; deeper intramonth (**−7.50%**), **TTR — not recovered (n/a)**. Time underwater: **EoM 38 months**, **Intramonth 38 months**.
- Monthly premium: mean/median month **0.23% / 0.21%**.
- Calendar stability: best year **2003 (7.71%)**, worst **2005 (−3.99%)**; “zero” months **4**.
- Sample size: coverage **5** years, **60** months; number of trades: **342**.
- Risk‑management stress marks: **EoM MaxDD ≈ −5.54%**, **Intramonth MaxDD ≈ −7.50%**; expectation benchmark — **average month ≈ 0.23%**.
> **Summary:** moderate growth with low volatility. Drawdowns are shallow, yet the high watermark was not recovered within the observation window; time underwater can extend to ~3 years. Intramonth swings are deeper than EoM but remain in single‑digit percentages. Returns are driven by steady, small monthly gains without extreme spikes.

### Trades summary
- Sample size: **342** trades; win rate **69.88%**.
- Profile quality: **Profit factor 1.19**, **Payoff 0.51** (avg win/|avg loss|).
- Per‑trade expectancy: **mean 0.04 R**, **median 0.28 R**.
- R‑distribution: **σ ≈ 0.56 R**, **min -1.03 R**, **max 0.57 R**.
- Average outcomes: **avg win 0.37 R**, **avg loss -0.72 R**.
> **Summary:** positive expectancy achieved through a high share of winning trades with **payoff < 1** (average profit smaller than average loss). The profile is close to “frequent small wins vs. less frequent larger losses”; stability is maintained by hit rate and per‑trade risk control.

### Yearly summary
- Coverage: **5** years (2003–2007). Mean/median calendar year: **2.82% / 3.07%**.
- Best year: **2003 (7.71%)**; worst year: **2005 (-3.99%)**.
- Drawdowns (within the year, from peak): **EoM -4.70% → -1.08%**, **Intramonth -5.54% → -2.23%**.
- Trading activity: total trades across years **342**; yearly averages — win rate **69.55%**, PF **1.19**.
> **Summary:** at the yearly horizon, results are moderate and even: the average calendar year is ~**2.82%** with limited in‑year drawdowns (typically single digits). Best and worst years remain within moderate bounds; the positive average is sustained by an acceptable frequency of profitable months and controlled drawdown depth.

### Monthly returns
- Coverage: **60** months (2003–2007). Mean/median month: **0.23% / 0.21%** (P10/P90: **-1.09% / 1.64%**).
- Symmetry: positive months **37**, negative **19**, zero **4**.
- Extremes: best month **2004-02 (2.92%)**, worst month **2005-07 (-2.92%)**.
- Runs by month: maximum winning streak — **10** consecutive months, maximum losing streak — **4** consecutive months; months with zero return interrupt any streak.
> **Summary:** the behavior of monthly returns is consistent with a profile featuring a moderate premium and bounded tails (P10/P90 in a narrow range). Stability is supported by the frequency of positive months and the absence of prolonged losing streaks.

### Cash flows (USD)
- Coverage: **4** events across 2003–2006.
- Cash flows: **deposits (cash‑in)** 3,993.55 (1 event), **withdrawals (cash‑out)** 17,919.04 (3 events)
- **Profit for the last year** 169.27.
> **Summary:** net profit ~ **14094.76**.

### Conclusion
Overall, the track shows moderate, even growth with low variability: drawdowns are shallow, although recovery of peaks can be protracted; the monthly premium is modest yet stable; yearly dynamics avoid extremes. Performance is sustained by a high share of profitable periods alongside a modest **payoff**, which calls for disciplined risk management. Intramonth fluctuations are deeper but remain controlled.
