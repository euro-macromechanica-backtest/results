# 📊 Data Quality Policy (M1→M5, EMM intraday strategy on 5-minute bars)

Version: **v1.0**

This policy puts **5–15-minute gaps** in the M1 stream **front and center**.  
Other anomaly types are reported **for transparency** but are **not gating criteria**.

---

## 🧭 Definitions & anti–cherry-picking

- **Core Baseline (2008–…):** the primary, quality-consistent period **after a structural shift** in the feed (sharp drop in 5–15-minute gaps).
- **Extended Baseline (2003–2007):** earlier years added for historical breadth; **data quality differs from Core** (higher frequency of 5–15-minute gaps). Metrics are **reported separately**.
- **Stress (2001–2002):** years with systematically high gap levels; used **only** for stress illustration.

### Inclusion rules (fixed before publishing results)

- **Core rule (strict):** the baseline starts at the first year `t` such that  
  1) annual **5–15-minute gaps < 1000**, and  
  2) years `t+1` and `t+2` also have **< 1000**.  
  *The start rule is fixed **ex ante** (relative to PnL): the first year followed by two more years each with <1000 gaps. In today’s data that is **2008**; it’s a consequence of the rule, **not** a post-hoc choice.*

- **Extended rule (broad):** a year is in Extended Baseline if annual **5–15-minute gaps < 2500**.  
  *This covers 2003–2007, showing the strategy over a wider window **with lower data quality** than Core (more 5–15-minute gaps).*

> 🔒 Rules and windows are **cryptographically anchored** (SHA-256 / GPG / OpenTimestamps) **before** publishing results — see “Transparency & Precommitment.”

## 📌 Rationale for prioritizing 5–15-minute gaps

On an M5 timeframe, **frequent 5–15-minute gaps** impair bar construction and misalign entry/exit triggers.  
Accordingly, the **annual count of 5–15-minute gaps** is the principal determinant of a year’s baseline eligibility.  
Other anomalies are documented but **not** used as exclusion thresholds.

---

## 📏 Reporting policy

- **Core and Extended metrics are computed separately** and **not pooled** into one set.  
- **Headline metrics are published only for Core Baseline.**  
- A *pooled view* is allowed as a **reference indicator over a long historical window** and must be labeled **mixed quality**; it is **not used for headline claims**.

---

## 📂 Current classification

- **⭐ Core Baseline:** 2008–2025-08  
- **📦 Extended Baseline:** 2003–2007  
- **🧪 Stress:** 2001–2002

## 🗂️ Reporting tracks

- ⚠️ **Stress (2001–2002)** — no metrics computed; illustrates behavior on low-quality data.
- ⭐ **Core Baseline (2008–2025-08)** — headline.
- 📦 **Extended Baseline (2003–2007)** — secondary; computed separately.
- 🧩 **Composite (Extended+Core, 2003–2025-08)** — a **reference pooled view over a long historical window** (mixed quality); not used for headline claims.

### Cost profiles

Detailed cost models *(commission, spread, and slippage)* for each profile are described in [`Euro Macromechanica (EMM) Backtest – Overview & Methodology`](https://github.com/euro-macromechanica-backtest/results/blob/main/README.md) and [`results/README.md`](https://github.com/euro-macromechanica-backtest/results/blob/main/results/README.md).

Cost profiles are named by their model:
- **Retail-Standard** — standard retail conditions;
- **Retail-Rebate** — retail with a commission rebate/cashback applied;
- **Institutional** — institutional conditions.

**All cost components for each profile are included in the PnL calculation.**

> Precommitment applies to the data-quality table only. Any future changes to costs will be released as separate results with a new cost-model identifier.
